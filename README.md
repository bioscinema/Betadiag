# Betadiag

Diagnostics and Remedy Tools for Beta Diversity Analysis

Betadiag is an R package designed to diagnose, evaluate, and correct issues in beta diversity analysis, particularly when working with dissimilarity matrices from ecological and microbiome studies. It provides tools to assess matrix properties, perform ordination and statistical evaluation, and apply remedies to ensure valid analysis.

## Installation

To install the development version of Betadiag from GitHub:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("bioscinema/Betadiag")
library(Betadiag)
```

## Key Features

- Check whether dissimilarity matrices are metric and Euclidean
- Assess triangle inequality violations, collinearity, and nonlinearity
- Convert dissimilarity matrices into Gram matrices
- Perform Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and eigenvalue decomposition
- Conduct PERMANOVA and pseudo RÂ² analysis for association testing
- Apply Higham or Tikhonov corrections to enforce positive semi-definiteness
- Compute weighted UniFrac distances directly from phyloseq objects
