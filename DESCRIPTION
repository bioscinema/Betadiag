Description: This package provides a suite of tools for diagnosing and addressing issues in beta diversity analysis. It helps assess data quality, identify potential biases, and apply corrections to improve the robustness of diversity comparisons. 
  Features include diagnostic checks for beta diversity metrics, detection of biases and anomalies, remediation strategies for improving analysis accuracy, and support for various ecological and microbiome datasets. 
  The package includes functions for converting dissimilarity matrices to Gram matrices, performing Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), conducting PERMANOVA, checking matrix properties, and applying remedies for non-Euclidean behavior.
